				<h1>Why is Learning English is so Important?</h1>
				<p>
					English is the language of science, of aviation, computers, diplomacy, and tourism. 
					Knowing English increases your chances of getting a good job in a multinational 
					company within your home country or for finding work abroad. It’s also the 
					language of international communication, the media and the internet, 
					so learning English is important for socialising and entertainment 
					as well as work!
					
					<ol>
						<li>English is the Language of International Communication</li>

						<p>
							English may not be the most spoken language in the world, but it is the 
							official language of 53 countries and spoken by around 400 million people 
							across the globe. Being able to speak English is not just about being able 
							to communicate with native English speakers, it is the most common second 
							language in the world. If you want to speak to someone from another country 
							then the chances are that you will both be speaking English to do this.
						</p>
						<p>
							The British Council projects that by 2020 two billion people in the world 
							will be studying English. Learning English is important as it enables you 
							to communicate easily with your fellow global citizens. When you study 
							English at ELC schools, you will be making friends with people from lots 
							of different countries, using English as your common language!
						</p>
						
						<li> English is the Language of Business</li>
						<img src="business.jpg" alt="world_languages_logo" width="200px"/>
						<p>
							English is the dominant business language and it has become almost a necessity 
							for people to speak English if they are to enter a global workforce. Research 
							from all over the world shows that cross-border business communication is most 
							often conducted in English and many international companies expect employees 
							to be fluent in English.
						</p>
						<p>
							Global companies such as Airbus, Daimler-Chrysler, Fast Retailing, Nokia, Renault, 
							Samsung, SAP, Technicolor, and Microsoft in Beijing, have mandated English as their 
							official corporate language. In addition, in 2010 the company Rakuten, a Japanese 
							cross between Amazon and eBay, made it mandatory for their 7,100 Japanese employees 
							to be able to speak English.
							The importance of learning English in the international marketplace cannot be 
							understated - learning English really can change your life.
						</p>
						
						<li>Speaking English gives you Access to a World of Entertainment</li>
						<img src="entertainment.jpg" alt="world_languages_logo" width="200px"/>
						<p>
							Many of the world’s top films, books and music are published and produced in English. 
							Therefore, by learning English you will have access to a great wealth of entertainment 
							and will be able to have a greater cultural understanding.

							If you speak English, you won't need to rely on translations and subtitles anymore to 
							enjoy your favourite books, songs, films and TV shows. Watching movies and television 
							programmes in the English language is also a great and fun way to learn it!
						</p>
						<p>
							At ELC we encourage students to participate in the social programme to practice English 
							outside a class environment. Activities include watching popular English films, sports, 
							art galleries, museums, trips and excursions to local and historical areas. The programme 
							is designed to encourage students to use and learn English in British culture.
						</p>
						
						<li>Learning English gives you Access to more of the Internet</li>
						<img src="internet.jpg" alt="world_languages_logo" width="200px"/>
						<p>
							According to a report by Education First, English is the language of the internet. An 
							estimated 565 million people use the internet every day, and an estimated 52 percent 
							of the world’s most visited websites are displayed in the English language.
							Learning English is important as it gives you access to over half the content on the 
							internet. Knowing how to read English will allow you access to billions of pages of 
							information which may not be otherwise available!
