			<h1>Culture</h1>
			
			<h2>British Culture</h2>
			<img id="uk_culture" src="uk_culture1.jpg" alt="uk culture" width="200px"/>
				<h3>Social Norms</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>	
						<li>
							The British are punctual. Being late is odd and, in some cases, considered to be rude. 
							If you’re going to be late to something, contact those involved as soon as you know 
							you will be late. Also, it is less rude to be late to a dinner party at someone’s 
							home than it is to be late to a public meeting (such as dinner at a restaurant).
						</li>
						<li>
							In the UK, it’s acceptable to keep one arm’s length between yourself and those you 
							are speaking with. Any closer is assumed to be aggressive and can be uncomfortable 
							for those native to UK.
						</li>
						<li>
							British people rarely use superlatives and are not very animated when they speak. 
							They value privacy over everything else, so be careful what you ask because you could 
							be prying without meaning to.
						</li>
						<li>
							British people often avoid extended eye contact. They find it uncomfortable and 
							intimidating.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are invited to the home of a native British person, it is normal to bring 
							along a gift, such as chocolate, wine, or flowers to say thank you.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you go to a pub with your friends, it is common practice to buy a round of drinks 
							for those who you came with.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<p>
					<b>Fish and chips</b><br>
					Perhaps the most typical British food. The history of this food in UK’s culture is so long. 
					It is thought that once in the past an employer had to hire a doorman to control the queue 
					of people waiting to buy Fish and chips. The plate contains a deep-fried fish and potato 
					chips (fries for American readers). British people prefer the cod and Haddock over other 
					sorts of fish. You can also prepare some boiled peas mixed with salt, pepper or other ingredients.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Sunday Roast with Yorkshire pudding</b><br>
					One cannot talk about the British food without mentioning the Sunday Roast with Yorkshire pudding. 
					Usually served on Sundays afternoons, however, you can eat during the week also. You can ask for a 
					roast dinner with a chicken, turkey or whatever, but you definitely should not miss the Yorkshire pudding. 
					Commonly the Yorkshire pudding is accompanied with beef.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Eccles cake</b><br>
					Delicious round small cakes containing currants. It’s named after a town in Manchester with the same name. 
					Across UK you can find different versions of this delicious food because it’s not strictly associated with 
					a particular place.
				</p>
				
				
			<h2>American Culture</h2>
			<img id="us_culture" src="us_culture1.jpg" alt="uk culture" width="200px"/>
				<h3>Social Norms</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>	
						<li>
							When you say “Hello” to someone, he or she may answer “Hello, how are you?” or “Hey, how's it going?” 
							This is a common expression and you do not have to explain how you are really feeling. 
						</li>
						<li>
							In general, Americans appreciate punctuality when you have arranged to meet for dinner or lunch, for 
							medical and business appointments, or in a public place. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Americans tend to celebrate many holidays marking historical, cultural, and religious events. Some are 
							very formal or somber, while others are silly and fun. During certain national holidays, government offices, 
							banks, and other businesses will be closed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Written invitations should be answered in writing, unless a telephone number is given. When no answer is 
							expected, the invitation will not have the letters “RSVP” written on it. If the invitation is made over 
							the phone, be sure to understand the date, the day of the week, the time, and the place.
						</li>
						<li>
							An invitation to an American home will give you a chance to see American family life. Most American 
							households do not have domestic help, so it is courteous to offer your help to your hosts. Unless the 
							host or hostess says otherwise, do not begin eating until he or she is seated at the table. If you 
							have any dietary restrictions, do not hesitate to say so beforehand. You do not have to bring a gift 
							when you are invited to dinner, except on special occasions, like a birthday or holiday.
						</li>
						<li>
							In addition to paying for products and services, many Americans will also offer a small gratuity to 
							certain service workers. While leaving a tip is voluntary, it has become expected in some industries 
							and it is considered rude not to leave a tip (unless service was very bad).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Burgers</b><br>
					Burgers are a central part of American food and culture. They are the main staple of many fast food places, 
					are found at tons of other restaurants, and are grilled in backyards countrywide.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Apple Pie</b><br>
					While burgers are iconic and found virtually everywhere, it’s hard to argue that any food is more classically 
					American than apple pie.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>French Fries</b><br>
					Potatoes are incredibly versatile, but if you asked many Americans what their favorite way to have a potato cooked is, 
					they’re probably going to say french fries.
				</p>
				
				
			<h2>Australian Culture</h2>	
			<img id="au_culture" src="au_culture1.jpg" alt="uk culture" width="200px"/>
				<h3>Social Norms</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>	
						<li>
							Australian culture is not very formal, so greetings are typically casual and relaxed. A handshake, smile and a simple 
							'hello, how are you' should suffice.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are attending a party or a similar type of informal event, then handshakes may be replaced with a simple greeting.
						</li>
						<li>
							Aussies prefer to use first names, even at the initial meeting.  As such, avoid using titles when you first meet someone 
							and, instead, introduce yourself with your first name only. 
						</li>
						<li>
							As Australian culture is fairly tactile, close friends may kiss each other on the cheek or exchange a quick backslap or hug.
							However, you should avoid hugging, kissing or back slapping anyone unless you know them well and in a social setting.
						</li>
						<li>
							Small gifts are commonly exchanged with family members, close friends, and neighbours to mark special events such as 
							birthdays, births, engagements or Christmas.
						</li>
						<li>
							With the value placed on humility and equality, it's important that gifts are modest and not too expensive.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<p>
					<b>Hamburger with beetroot</b><br>
					You can eat burgers all over the world, but nothing is more Australian than slinging a piece of beetroot on top a pattie made 
					with Aussie beef. That soft bun, all-beef pattie and cheese is simply not properly done without the finishing touch of beetroot.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Green chicken curry pie</b><br>
					Australians love Thai food. They also love pies (a lot). Put a Thai chicken green curry inside a pie casing and you get the Aussie variant of a green curry.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Fantales</b><br>
					A favorite Australian food, the delectable bite-sized treat is made up of chewy caramel coated in milk chocolate. It's renowned for yellow and blue wrapping 
					scribed with movie trivia, a marketing move that has endeared the treat to DVD groupies and movie goers.
